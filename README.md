# MLP_training
Training of a Multilayer Perceptron in order to predict the estimation of droplet/bubbles curvatures.




This is a project as part of the secondment that I conducted at ETH Zurich. 
In this repo a MLP is trained (after scaling the data and using DataLoader to enter then into the network).
Different metrics have been used (e.g. loss function over each epoch, relative error and abolute error evolution over each epoch and more) to evaluate our network.
